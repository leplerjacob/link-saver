## Description
An app that allows you to easily keep track of saved email addresses, website urls, or any text you find yourself copying often.

## Why?
I wanted an extension that I could easily keep track of common things I find myself copy/pasting. These were things like profile links, common headings, email addresses. 

## Future
I'd like to implement a way to easily highlight text on a webpage of what it is you want to save and for it appear in the table of saved texts.

## Contribution
This is the first chrome extension project I have been involved. If you would like to contribute, please feel free to open an issue or throw a comment in the discussion :)
